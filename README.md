Programming 2 Course Project
Description:

This repository contains the Golfkerho Management System project developed as part of a programming course.
The project focused on building a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX to manage club activities and members.
This program handles an imaginary golfclub and its' members.

Tools and Technologies Used

    - Programming Language: Java
    - Development Environment: Eclipse/SceneBuilder
    - GUI Framework: JavaFX
    - Version Control: Git Bash and GitLab (this GitHub repository is created later for preserving purposes)
    - Styling: CSS

Project Structure:

    - KerhoMain.java: The main entry point for the application.
    - GUIController.java-files: Handle the functions of the program.
    - GUIView.fxml-files: Handle the GUI structure.
    - kerho.css: CSS-file for styling the application.
    - Kuvat: Contains screenshots of the application.
    - golfkerho.jar: Executable program.

Features:

    - Modular Structure: Each functionality is separated into different controllers and FXML files.
    - User Management: Add, edit, and manage club members and their details.
    - Club Management: Create and manage different clubs and their activities.
    - User Interface: Intuitive and user-friendly interface designed using JavaFX.
    - Printing: Functionality to print information.
    - Custom Styling: Application styling managed through CSS for a consistent look and feel.

Objectives:
Through this project, the aim was to strengthen the following programming skills:

    - Object-oriented programming in Java using classes and inheritance.
    - GUI development using JavaFX and FXML.
    - Implementing modular and maintainable code structures.
    - Handling user input and controls within a graphical user interface.
    - Managing application state and object interactions.
    - Handling reading and writing into files.
    - Applying custom styling using CSS for JavaFX applications.
    - Using version control systems effectively for project management.
